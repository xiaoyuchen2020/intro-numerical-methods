Our goal is to provide a model that properly classifies any test image of handwritten $0$ or $1$ into proper category. \n",

A efficient and accurate model for recognizing handwritten digits could be used to solve more complex image recognition problems.

    "We want to test the effect of convolution on the performance of image classification. Here we use $40$ images of $0$ digits and $40$ images of $1$ digits. We split half of them into training data and half of them into testing data randomly. Since the original pixel value ranges from $0$ to $255$, we also standardized the values to avoid the effect of certain large numbers. We use the radial basis function with default scale length $1$ as the kernel function. "

    "Here the prediction gives the predicted mean of each image, which explains why some of the values are greater than $1$ or smaller than $0$. We can see that the model gives more confident predictions comparing to the previous case using invariant convolutional kernel. The result shows that by applying a properly weighted convolutional kernel, we could create a better classification model. The convolutional kernel is also helpful in reducing the input size when the data has high dimension. "
