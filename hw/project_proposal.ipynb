    "Topic: Exploring the Efficiency of Gaussian Process Regression in High-Dimensional Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary: Gaussian process is a stochastic process such that every finite collection of those random variables has a multivariate normal distribution. Benefiting from its inherited property of normal distribution, it is useful in approximating models in statistical modeling. One way of utilizing it will be using Gaussian process regression to approximate a computationally expansive model to reduce the computational cost. However, the computational complexity for Gaussian process itself increases rapidly with the increasing size or dimension of the data. The project will investigate methods such as inducing points to approximate large datasets, exploring different covariance functions to better capture relationships in data, and testing various sampling strategies to enhance model performance and scalability. By benchmarking these techniques on real-world datasets, this project aims to demonstrate practical improvements in computational efficiency while maintaining or improving prediction accuracy, thereby making Gaussian Process regression more accessible for high-dimensional problems across diverse fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is important as many real world models in areas like physics and medical are complex, high-dimensional, and computationally demanding. Efficient Gaussian process regression acting as surrogate could significantly reduce the computational burden in these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools that will be used include Python and scikit-learn library for modeling Gaussian process, and possibly some R programming if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this project, I hope I can get a deeper understanding of Gaussian Process theory, especially as it applies to high-dimensional problems, and gain practical experience in applying advanced approximation techniques. In addition, hopefully an efficient Gaussian process regression model for some real world data set. "
